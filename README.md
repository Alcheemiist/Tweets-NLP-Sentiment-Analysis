# Tweets Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project is an introduction to natural language processing: 
  
  - bag of words
  - TFIDF
  - stemming
  - lemmatization
  - stop-words
  - cosine similarity
  - n-grams
  - word2vec

## Goal

The goal of this project is to take a first approach to NLP. We'll try to preprocess text data and train different classifiers to solve a classification task with the best possible score.

## Task

In this project, we'll work on sentiment analysis of tweets. we'll need to predict whether a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.
  
  - Data preparation. Transform tweets into vectors using different approaches.
  - Similarity. Find the top 10 most similar pairs of tweets using datasets with different preprocessing.
  - Machine learning. Using different machine learning algorithms and different datasets with different preprocessing conduct sentiment analysis.

## Dataset
 
 - We'll work with the tweet dataset. The tweets are labelled as positive, negative, and neutral. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashank1558/preprocessed-twitter-tweets)
