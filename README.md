# Tweets Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project is an introduction to natural language processing: 
  
  • bag of words
  • TFIDF
  • stemming
  • lemmatization
  • stop-words
  • cosine similarity
  • n-grams
  • word2vec

## Goal

The goal of this project is to have a first approach to NLP. we'll try to preprocess text data and train different classifiers trying to solve a classification task with the best possible score.

## Task

In this project, we'll work on sentiment analysis of tweets. we'll need to predict whether a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.
  
  • Data preparation. Transform tweets into vectors using different approaches.
  • Similarity. Find the top-10 most similar pair of tweets using datasets with different preprocessing.
  • Machine learning. Using different machine learning algorithms and different datasets with different preprocessing conduct sentiment analysis.

## Dataset
 
 • we'll work with the dataset of tweets. The tweets are labeled as positive, negative, and neutral. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashank1558/preprocessed-twitter-tweets)
